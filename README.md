Hello, 
  my name is Curtis.

I have two projects that seem to be going nowhere.
No-matter how close i think i am to finding answers, i only get side tracked.

The first thing is learnig how to master android.
At first, i was amazed with the linux part, and started writing as soon as i discovered this little googy.

The other...
...find a system i can use to plug in all the little gaps in my code, and when i say gaps
...i mean...
...if the code was contributed from some system that is still holding the red pen i have total disgust in accusation of even tring.
I dont use already been bugged software...
Take notes, adjust a few things, but never copy word for word.


OK:
These gaps
Some of them
REMEBER:
python only
NO:
3rd party what ifs

1) image
  
  a) converting
  
  b) displaying
  
  c) editing

2) sound and music editing

3) system event trapping

4) camera and other device handling like wifi adapters

5) keyboard and mouse trapping


If you read this.... and have any direction....please e-mail me
